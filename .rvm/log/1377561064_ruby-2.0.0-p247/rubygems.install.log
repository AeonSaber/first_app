=== 2.0.0 / 2013-02-24

RubyGems 2.0 includes several new features and many breaking changes.  Some of
these changes will cause existing software to break.  These changes are a
result of improvements to the internals of RubyGems that make it more
maintainable and improve APIs for RubyGems users.

If you are using bundler be sure to install a 1.3.0.prerelease version or
newer.  Older versions of bundler will not work with RubyGems 2.0.

Changes since RubyGems 1.8.25 (including past pre-releases):

* Breaking changes:

  * Deprecated Gem.unresolved_deps in favor of
    Gem::Specification.unresolved_deps
  * Merged Gem::Builder into Gem::Package.  Use Gem::Package.build(spec)
    instead of Gem::Builder.new(spec).build
  * Merged Gem::Format into Gem::Package.  Use Gem::Package.new instead
    of Gem::Format.from_file_by_path
  * Moved Gem::OldFormat to Gem::Package::Old.  Gem::Package will
    automatically detect old gems for you, so there is no need to refer to it.
  * Removed Gem::DocManager, replaced by Gem::RDoc and done_installing hook
  * Removed Gem::Package::TarInput in favor of Gem::Package

    #166
  * Added --document to replace --rdoc and --ri.  Use --no-document to disable
    documentation, --document=rdoc to only generate rdoc.
  * Only ri-format documentation is generated by default.
  * `gem server` uses RDoc::Servlet from RDoc 4.0 to generate HTML
    documentation.
  * Add ability to install gems directly from a compatible gemdep
    file (Gemfile, Isolate, gem.deps.rb)
    <code>gem install --file path</code>
  * Add ability to load gem activation information from a gemdeps
    file (Gemfile, Isolate, gem.deps.rb).
    Set RUBYGEMS_GEMDEPS=path to have it loaded. Use - as the path
    to autodetect (current and parent directories are searched).

* Minor enhancements:
  * Added `gem check --doctor` to clean up after failed uninstallation.  Bug
    #419 by Erik Hollensbe
  * RubyGems no longer defaults to uninstalling gems if a dependency would be
    broken.  Now you must manually say "yes".  Pull Request #406 by Shannon

    can specify per-gem versions like <code>rake:0.9.5</code>
  * Clarified Gem::CommandManager example code to avoid multi load problems.
    (baroquebobcat)
  * Corrupt or bad cached specs are now re-downloaded. (cookrn)
  * Extension build arguments are saved from install and reused for pristine

    process. (alexch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RubyGems installed the following executables:
	/home/student/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p247/bin/gem

Ruby Interactive (ri) documentation was installed. ri is kind of like man 
pages for ruby libraries. You may access it like this:
  ri Classname
  ri Classname.class_method
  ri Classname#instance_method
If you do not wish to install this documentation in the future, use the
--no-document flag, or set it as the default in your ~/.gemrc file. See
'gem help env' for details.
